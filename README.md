# C-SFML-Ratcatchers-Revenge-Game
About:

The ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenger’ is a C++ project that utilizing the SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and builds on ‘Zombie Arena’; a game from John Horton’s ‘Beginning C++ Programming (Second Edition)’ book (published by Packt and online course (through Udemy and developed by Packt).  The purpose of creating ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenger’ is to build on the skills and knowledge I developed from Mr. Horton’s book/course.  I will be using the code from ‘Zombie Arena’ as the starting point for the development of the ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenger’.


---------------------

The Story:

Welcome to the ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenge’.  YOU are from a noble order of Ratcatchers, tasked with cleansing the City from the disease-ridden hordes of rats and vermin that dwell in the sewers and labyrinths beneath the City.  Six months ago, a vile group of cultists released large quantities of bio-engineered cheese into the ‘Under-city’.  The rats were drawn to the cheese, which caused their bodies to grow and mutant; new species of rats emerged.  These new more powerful rats soon overwhelmed the noble cats; the first line of defense against the vermin hordes.  Waves of Ratcatcher were sent to the sewers and labyrinths beneath the City to avenge the fallen cats and to prevent the horde of vermin from entering the City.  Fierce battles were fought, and many Ratcatchers fell.  Now, the once mighty order of Ratcatchers is reduced to a third of their number.  However, the battle continues, and the rat must be stopped.  YOU are tasked with entering the ‘Under City’ to prevent the hordes of rat from consuming the City.
