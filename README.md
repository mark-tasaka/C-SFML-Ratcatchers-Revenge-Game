About:
The ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenger’ is a C++ project that utilizing the SFML library (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) and builds on ‘Zombie Arena’; a game from John Horton’s ‘Beginning C++ Programming (Second Edition)’ book (published by Packt and online course (through Udemy and developed by Packt).  The purpose of creating ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenger’ is to build on the skills and knowledge I developed from Mr. Horton’s book/course.  I will be using the code from ‘Zombie Arena’ as the starting point for the development of the ‘Ratcatcher’s Revenger’.
